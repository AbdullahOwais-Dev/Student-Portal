  <p><div class="Note"><h2>Note for SIR</h2></div><hr><i><strong>This project is a tribute to Sir Salman Qazi</strong>, whose guidance and dedication to teaching have inspired countless students, including myself. A special thanks to him for shaping this learning journey and for always being a beacon of knowledge and support. </p><br>
  <p>I'd also like to extend my gratitude to everyone who has contributed in some way to this journey, from friends and mentors to peers who have shared their insights and encouragement. This project is not just a task, but a symbol of everything I've learned and the people who helped me along the way. </p>
  <p>With every line of code and every challenge overcome, this is a small token of appreciation for those who have guided me in the world of programming and beyond.</p><hr><br>
  <p><strong>Additionally, I would like to inform Sir Salman Qazi</strong> that I utilized various resources in the development of this project. I used AI tools to brainstorm the project idea and assist with creating the documentation. In certain sections of the code, I referred to Google search, the official PHP manual, and Bootstrap documentation to ensure best practices. However, I can confidently state that I fully understand the code I have written and am sure of the logic and functionality that drives the project.</p>
  <p>This project represents not just a learning milestone, but a true reflection of the knowledge and resources I've absorbed under your guidance.</i></p>
